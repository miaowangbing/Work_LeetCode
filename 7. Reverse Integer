Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Update (2014-11-10):
Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {//题目虽然简单 但需要考虑细节问题 溢出处理
        long long int res=0;
        long long int t=x;//防止在将负数转成正数时溢出【正数表示范围小于负数表示范围】
        int flag=1;
        if(t<0){
            flag=-1;
            t=-t;
        }
        do{
            res=10*res+t%10;
        }while(t/=10);
        if(res>2147483647)return 0;
        else return flag*res;
    }
};
