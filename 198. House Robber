You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you 
from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected 
and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len=nums.size();
        if(len==0)return 0;//不存在元素
        if(len==1)return nums[0];//存在一个元素
        vector<int> dp(len,0);//dp[i]表示到达i房间时的最大收益
        //dp[i]=max(dp[i-2]+nums[i],dp[i-1])——状态转移
        dp[0]=nums[0];
        dp[1]=max(nums[0],nums[1]);
        for(int i=2;i<len;++i)
            dp[i]=max(dp[i-2]+nums[i],dp[i-1]);//状态转移
        return dp[len-1];
    }
};
