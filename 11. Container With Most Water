Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {//二点法——高度取决于两者小值
        int len=height.size();
        int left=0,right=len-1;
        int res=0;
        while(left<=right){
            int temp=min(height[left],height[right])*(right-left);
            res=max(res,temp);
            if(height[left]<=height[right])left++;//更新
            else right--;//更新
        }
        return res;
    }
};
